# Building My Portfolio Website

This portfolio website was built to showcase my projects and skills as a developer. I wanted to create something that was fast, responsive, and easy to update.

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: For static site generation and routing
- **React**: For interactive components
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **MDX**: For content management

## Features

### Dark Mode Toggle

The site includes a dark mode toggle that respects the user's system preferences but also allows manual control.

```tsx
// ModeToggle.tsx
export function ModeToggle() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<"light" | "dark">("light");

  useEffect(() => {
    const isDark = document.documentElement.classList.contains("dark");
    setTheme(isDark ? "dark" : "light");
  }, []);

  function toggleTheme() {
    const isDark = document.documentElement.classList.contains("dark");
    document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", !isDark);
    setTheme(!isDark ? "dark" : "light");
  }

  return (
    <Button variant="ghost" size="icon" onClick={toggleTheme}>
      {theme === "light" ? <Moon size={18} /> : <Sun size={18} />}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

### Page Transitions

Smooth page transitions were implemented using Framer Motion to enhance the user experience:

```tsx
const PageTransition = ({ children, pathname }: Props) => {
  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
      <motion.div
        key={pathname}
        initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
      >
        {children}
      </motion.div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
};
```

## Deployment

The site is deployed on Vercel, which provides automatic deployments on every push to the main branch. The build process is optimized for performance, resulting in very fast load times.

## Future Improvements

I plan to add more features to this site in the future, including:

- A blog section
- Filtering projects by technology
- More interactive elements
- Improved accessibility
